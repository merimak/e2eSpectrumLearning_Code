# *End-to-end* learning for spectrum monitoring: A deep learning based approach

This repository provides a code example for end-to-end learning from spectrum data.

***End-to-end* learning** refers to processing architectures where the entire pipeline, connecting the input to the desired output,
is learned purely from data.

***End-to-end* learning from spectrum data** is a unified approach that can tackle various challenges related to the problems of inefficient spectrum management,
utilization and regulation that the next generation of wireless communication systems are facing. 
Whether the goal is to recognize a technology or a particular modulation type, identify the interference source or an interference-free frequency channel, we argue
that the various problems may be treated as a generic problem type that we refer to as RF *signal identification* for which a unified solution applies.

The code provides modules for setting up and training a CNN network, and collecting performance evaluation results for wireless signal modulation recognition.
